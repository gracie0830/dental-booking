	<h1>Crown Process</h1>
	<p>
		The tooth that requires a crown is usually reduced in size by 1-2mm and an impression is made of the prepared tooth, which is sent to the lab for processing. During the impression stage, the dentist takes the shade of your other adjacent natural teeth to match the color of the crown to the natural teeth. It is usually a 2 visit procedure. After the first visit , a temp crown will be fabricated and cemented with a temporary cement. Approximately 10-14 days later we will receive the permanent crown from the lab, that will be tried on your teeth and cemented permanently. A porcelain crown is expected to last around 5-15 years.
